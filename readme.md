# PhoneFeats
This is a Python script intended to help users of the HermitCrab Parser in Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx) to define the minimal features necessary to distinguish between all possibilites, given a specific inventory.

It also outputs a table of weighted phonetic distance.

It uses PanPhon (https://github.com/dmort27/panphon) for Parsing the IPA. It also uses a lightly adapted (specifying unicode encoding) version of minphonefeat from https://github.com/mhulden/minphonfeat to test natural classes.
